# 💬 Social Media Clone (aka: BrokenBird 🐦)

A gloriously scuffed social media clone built for fun, learning, and maybe a few tears.  
It has a frontend. It has a backend. But don’t expect much.

## ⚠️ Status

> 🚧 This project is **unfinished** and kind of a mess. Here's what's wrong:

- 😵 The **frontend is awful** — barely styled, layout is inconsistent, and responsiveness is non-existent.
- 🧃 The **chat functionality doesn’t work**. It's just... there. Clicking won't help.
- 🪓 The **tweets section is broken** — rendering bugs, out-of-order posts, and random layout shifts.

Use it at your own risk — or better yet, fix it and make it awesome!
